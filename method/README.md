# method/

## Purpose

This folder contains the core documentation that explains how the BSR (Butterfly Spiritual Resonance) 6.0 Numbers System works. Think of this as the "instruction manual" for the entire system – the rules, algorithms, scoring methods, and historical records that define how daily angel number messages are converted into chosen numbers.

## What Belongs Here

This folder houses three main categories of documents:

### 1. System Specification
- **`bsr_code_ready_spec.md`** – The authoritative, technical specification for BSR 6.0. This document defines the exact step-by-step algorithm that will eventually be automated. It covers constellation formation, pattern recognition, scoring rules, convergence thresholds, and star extraction. This is the single most important document for understanding how the system operates deterministically.

### 2. Phase Documents
Documents that describe the evolution and development of the BSR system in phases:
- **Phase 1** – Frequency analysis and pattern atlas
- **Phase 2** – Master databases and historical records
- **Pre-Phase 3** – Critical insights and revelations

These documents track how the system has been developed, tested, and refined over time.

### 3. Reference Databases and Master Records
Historical logs, master databases, and complete documentation sets that provide:
- Frequency tables showing how often specific numbers appear
- Scoring system rules explaining how to evaluate candidates
- Architecture keys linking patterns to interpretations
- Complete registers of past angel messages and their outcomes
- Monthly master documents recording messages and results from specific time periods

## How This Folder Contributes to the System

The `method/` folder is the **knowledge foundation** of the BSR system. Every decision made when processing angel numbers – which patterns to look for, how to score candidates, when to apply bonuses, how to break ties – originates from the rules and principles documented here.

When someone wants to:
- **Understand** how the BSR system works → Read the documents in this folder
- **Apply** the system manually → Follow the rules described here
- **Automate** the system → Implement the algorithm in `bsr_code_ready_spec.md`
- **Verify** that results are correct → Check against the principles and examples in these documents
- **Improve** the system → Propose changes to the specification or phase documents

## Version Priority

The BSR system has evolved over time, and this folder contains documents from different versions. When there are conflicts or ambiguities:

**BSR 6.0 takes precedence.** The file `bsr_code_ready_spec.md` represents the current, authoritative version of the system.

Older documents (v2.0, earlier drafts) remain in this folder for:
- Historical context and reference
- Understanding how and why the system evolved
- Consulting alternative interpretations when BSR 6.0 is silent on a topic

If you encounter a rule in an older document that conflicts with BSR 6.0, always prefer BSR 6.0 unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Adding Documents to This Folder

When adding new documents to `method/`, follow these conventions:

### For Phase Documents
Use phase markers and descriptive emoji:
```
FASE [number][emoji] [Description].pdf
```
Example: `FASE 1🌟 ATLAS DE FRECUENCIAS BSR 6.0 - MAGISTRAL 💎.pdf`

### For Thematic Documents
Use semantic emoji prefixes:
- 🎯 = Scoring systems
- 🏛️ = Architecture guides
- 📊 = Databases
- 🦋 = Message registers/logs
- 📖 = Master documents or complete compilations

### For Dated Documents
Use timestamp format for version control:
```
_🌟[DD_MM_YY-HH_MM]🌟 [Description].pdf
```
Example: `_🌟27_10_25-17_21🌟 MEGA DOCUMENTO BSR-BUTTERFLY 6.0.pdf`

### For Specification Updates
When updating `bsr_code_ready_spec.md`:
1. Identify the ambiguity or missing rule you're addressing
2. Propose a clear, deterministic rule
3. Mark it as an **implementation assumption** if not directly derived from source documents
4. Ensure compatibility with the seven guiding principles (section 5 of the spec)
5. Commit with a descriptive message explaining the change

## Organization Guidelines

- **Keep the spec current** – As the system evolves, update `bsr_code_ready_spec.md` to reflect the authoritative rules
- **Preserve history** – Don't delete old documents; they provide valuable context
- **Document assumptions** – If you make a decision that isn't explicitly stated in source materials, mark it clearly as an assumption requiring validation
- **Maintain consistency** – Ensure new documents don't contradict BSR 6.0 unless they're proposing a formal revision

## For Newcomers

If you're new to the BSR system and want to understand how it works:

1. **Start here:** Read `bsr_code_ready_spec.md` (sections 1-4) for an overview of inputs, outputs, and core concepts
2. **Learn the patterns:** Review the PDF documents about architecture, frequencies, and scoring
3. **See examples:** Check the master registers and monthly documents to see real-world applications
4. **Understand evolution:** Browse the phase documents to see how the system developed

Don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately – the BSR system is sophisticated and draws on multiple concepts. The documents are written to be read together, with each one building on the others.

## Status: Specification Complete, Automation Planned

The documentation in this folder is **complete enough** to begin automation. The BSR 6.0 specification provides a deterministic algorithm, but there are:
- 6 explicit **implementation assumptions** that need validation
- Some missing external data (Sacred Scribes index, frequency tables)
- No formal test suite yet

These gaps are documented in the specification and in the repository's `CLAUDE.md` file.
