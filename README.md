# BSR Numbers System

This repository contains the working files, documents, and early structure for the BSR numbers system project.

**Current folders:**
- `method/` — core system documents, rules, and the automation spec  
- `architecture/` — pattern rules, portals, ladders, mirrors, sequences  
- `daily-logs/` — dated Mensajes Ángel logs  
- `references/` — external reference material  
- `inbox/` — temporary holding area for new files before sorting

This README is a placeholder and will be expanded once the full workflow and automation pipeline are established.
