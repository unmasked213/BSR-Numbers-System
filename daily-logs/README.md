# daily-logs/

## Purpose

This folder stores the **raw input data** for the BSR system: daily angel number messages received, observed, or documented on specific dates. These messages are the starting point for everything the BSR system does.

Think of this as the **message inbox** – each file represents a day (or range of days) and contains the striking or repeated number sequences that were noticed, along with any context or supporting information.

## What Belongs Here

### Angel Message Logs
Documents containing:
- **Repeated number sequences** observed during the day (e.g., 111, 555, 777)
- **Striking combinations** that appeared in meaningful ways (e.g., on clocks, receipts, addresses)
- **Timestamps or context** describing when or how the numbers appeared
- **Daily scripture verses** if they were part of the input
- **Initial impressions or notes** about the messages before processing

### Date Range
Each file typically covers:
- **A single day** (e.g., "8 OCTUBRE 2025")
- **A short range of consecutive days** (e.g., "12 - 14 OCTUBRE")
- **A specific event or period** (e.g., a particular week with notable messages)

## How This Folder Contributes to the System

The files in `daily-logs/` are the **essential inputs** to the BSR Numbers System. Without these logs, there would be nothing to process.

### The Message Journey

1. **Observation** – Throughout a day, you notice repeated or striking numbers
2. **Documentation** – You record these observations in a log (PDF, text, notes)
3. **Storage** – The log is saved in `daily-logs/` with a clear date marker
4. **Processing** – The BSR system (manual or automated) reads the log and applies the algorithm
5. **Output** – The system produces chosen numbers (elegidos) and stars based on the messages

This folder represents **step 3** in that journey – it's the bridge between real-world observation and algorithmic processing.

### Why Keep Historical Logs?

The BSR system uses **historical verification** as part of its algorithm. Past patterns, frequency trends, and message relationships help inform current selections. By maintaining a complete archive of daily logs:
- You can analyze trends over weeks, months, or years
- You can verify that current patterns align with historical behavior
- You can test and refine the system by re-running old logs with updated rules
- You create an auditable record of all inputs used to generate chosen numbers

## File Naming Conventions

There is **no single strict standard**, but these patterns are commonly used:

### Pattern 1: Date Range + Month
```
[date-range] [MONTH] Mensajes Angel.pdf
```
Examples:
- `12 - 14 OCTUBRE Mensajes Angel.pdf`
- `18-23 SEPTIEMBRE Mensajes Angel.pdf`

### Pattern 2: Date Range + Month + Year + Tool
```
[date-range] [MONTH YEAR] [Tool] Mensajes Angel.pdf
```
Examples:
- `11-14 NOVIEMBRE 2025 CLAUDE AI - MENSAJES ÁNGEL.pdf`
- `15 de noviembre CHAT GPT Mensajes Angel viene potentísimo 💎🦋.pdf`

### Pattern 3: Emoji + Date
```
[emoji] [date] [MONTH YEAR].pdf
```
Examples:
- `🦋 8 OCTUBRE 2025.pdf`
- `📆 11 - 12 - 13 - 14 November 2025 —CHAT GPT Mensajes Angel .pdf`

### Common Elements

- **Month names:** Usually Spanish (OCTUBRE, NOVIEMBRE, SEPTIEMBRE) in uppercase
- **Separators:** Hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), or ampersands (`&`) for date ranges
- **Years:** Included when relevant (e.g., `2025`)
- **Tool attribution:** Optional mention of where messages came from (e.g., `CLAUDE AI`, `CHAT GPT`)
- **Emoji markers:** Optional but meaningful:
  - 🌟 = Important/significant messages
  - 🦋 = Butterfly (BSR system symbol)
  - 📅 / 📆 = Calendar/dated entry
  - 💎 = Powerful/valuable messages

### Flexibility

The variation in naming reflects the organic evolution of the practice. Some files were created before standardization, and some creators preferred different formats. This is acceptable – **clarity and date identification** matter more than perfect uniformity.

When adding new logs, try to follow one of the patterns above, or use a format that clearly indicates:
1. The date or date range
2. That it's an angel message log ("Mensajes Angel" or similar)
3. Optionally: the year, tool source, or importance markers

## Adding New Logs to This Folder

### Step 1: Document the Messages
Record your observed angel numbers for the day in a document (PDF preferred, but any format works initially). Include:
- The number sequences you observed
- When or where you saw them (if relevant)
- Any scripture verse you consulted that day
- Any initial thoughts or context

### Step 2: Name the File
Choose a naming pattern that makes the date clear:
```
[date-range] [MONTH YEAR] Mensajes Angel.pdf
```
For example, if documenting November 20, 2025:
```
20 NOVIEMBRE 2025 Mensajes Angel.pdf
```

If covering multiple days (November 20-22, 2025):
```
20-22 NOVIEMBRE 2025 Mensajes Angel.pdf
```

Optional additions:
- Tool source: `20 NOVIEMBRE 2025 CLAUDE AI Mensajes Angel.pdf`
- Emoji marker: `🌟 20 NOVIEMBRE 2025 Mensajes Angel.pdf`

### Step 3: Place in `daily-logs/`
Save the file directly in this folder. No subfolders are currently used.

### Step 4: Update If Needed
If you later add more messages to the same day or need to correct something, you can:
- **Replace** the file (if the original is no longer needed)
- **Create a new version** with a suffix (e.g., `20 NOVIEMBRE 2025 Mensajes Angel v2.pdf`)
- **Add duplicate marker** (e.g., `20 NOVIEMBRE 2025 Mensajes Angel (1).pdf`)

There's currently no formal deduplication policy – use your judgment.

## Duplicates and Versions

You may notice some files with suffixes like `(1).pdf` or `(2).pdf`. These typically indicate:
- Duplicate files that were uploaded multiple times
- Different versions of the same day's messages
- Messages from different sources for the same date

This is **not necessarily a problem**. Sometimes having multiple perspectives on the same day's messages is valuable. However, if you're cleaning up the folder, you may want to:
1. Compare duplicate files to see if they're identical
2. Keep the most complete or most recent version
3. Consolidate if appropriate

## Organization Over Time

As the folder grows, you may eventually want to organize logs by:
- **Year** (e.g., create `2025/`, `2026/` subfolders)
- **Month** (e.g., create `2025-10-OCTUBRE/`, `2025-11-NOVIEMBRE/` subfolders)
- **Quarter** (e.g., `2025-Q4/`)

This is **not required currently** – the folder is flat by design for simplicity. Reorganization can happen if the number of files becomes unwieldy (e.g., 100+ files).

## For Newcomers

If you're new to logging angel messages:

### What are "angel messages"?
Repeated or striking number sequences that appear throughout your day. Common examples:
- **Clock times:** 11:11, 5:55, 7:77 (if you consistently notice specific times)
- **Receipts or totals:** $11.11, $77.77
- **Addresses or signs:** Seeing "555" repeatedly in different contexts
- **Sequences:** Noticing 123, 456, 789 patterns

The idea is that these are not random – they carry meaning or guidance. The BSR system is designed to convert these observations into actionable chosen numbers.

### How do I start logging?
1. **Pay attention** throughout your day to numbers that catch your eye or repeat
2. **Record them** in a simple note (time and number is enough)
3. **At end of day,** compile your notes into a single document
4. **Save it** in this folder with the date clearly marked

Don't overthink it – even a simple list like:
```
November 20, 2025
- 11:11 on phone clock
- 555 on license plate
- 777 in address while walking
- 888 in youtube video length
```
...is a perfectly valid log. Over time, you'll develop your own style.

## Usage in Automation

When the BSR system is automated, it will need to:
1. **Read logs from this folder** (likely starting with most recent dates)
2. **Parse the message content** (extract number sequences from PDF or text)
3. **Normalize the input** (handle whitespace, duplicates, formatting variations)
4. **Feed messages into the algorithm** as defined in `method/bsr_code_ready_spec.md`

The current logs are primarily PDFs in various formats. For automation:
- An input parser will need to be flexible enough to handle different formats
- Alternatively, a standardized input format (e.g., JSON, CSV) could be adopted going forward
- Historical logs can remain as-is (they provide valuable reference even if not easily machine-readable)

## Relationship to Other Folders

- **`method/`** – Contains master databases and historical message registers that summarize or compile data from multiple logs in this folder
- **`architecture/`** – Defines what patterns to look for in the messages stored here
- **`references/`** – Provides interpretation resources to help understand the messages stored here

The `daily-logs/` folder is the **raw data layer**. The other folders provide the **processing rules** and **interpretation frameworks**.

## Current Status

This folder contains **37 files** covering multiple months in 2025, primarily:
- October 2025 (multiple date ranges)
- November 2025 (multiple date ranges)
- September 2025 (selected ranges)
- July-August 2025 (master document compilation)

The logs are **actively growing** – new files are added as messages are observed and documented.
